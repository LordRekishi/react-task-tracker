# React Task Tracker

#### **Based upon the amazing [React crash course](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8) made by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia)**

This is a simple demo project made to practice React JS, this is my first experience with React. Previous experience mostly in Vue and vanilla JavaScript. Don't judge!
